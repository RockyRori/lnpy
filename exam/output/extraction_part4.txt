33There  are two  primary  types  of sampling  methods :
•Probability sampling involves random selection , allowing you to make strong 
statistical inferences about the whole group. [quatitative reseach]
•Non -probability sampling involves non -random selection based on 
convenience or other criteria, allowing you to easily collect data. [ exploratory 
and qualitative research ]

Simple Random Sample 
67 CDS 533Simple random sample  is a randomly selected subset of a population.
•Most straightforward 
•Lower risk for research biases like sampling bias and selection bias
Simple Random Sample 
68 CDS 533
•High  internal  validity : randomization  is the best  method  to reduce  the impact  of 
potential  confounding  variables .
•With  a large  enough  sample  size,  a simple  random  sample  has  high  external  validity : it 
represents  the characteristics  of the larger  population .
Simple Random Sample 
69 CDS 533•Simple random sampling can be challenging  to implement in practice. To use this 
method, there are some prerequisites, you
•have a complete list of every member of the population
•can contact or access each member of the population if they are selected
•have the time and resources to collect data from the necessary sample size
Simple  random  sampling  works  best  if you  have  a lot of time  and  resources  to conduct  
your  study,  or if you  are studying  a limited  population  that  can  easily  be sampled .Systematic Sampling 
70 CDS 533Systematic sampling is a method in which researchers select members of the population 
at a regular interval (or k) determined in advance.
•Applied with/without a list of the entire population
•It’s essential to consider the order in which your population is listed to ensure that 
your sample is valid.
Systematic Sampling 
71 CDS 533
You  should  not use  systematic  sampling  if your  population  is ordered  cyclically  or periodically,  
as your  resulting  sample  cannot  be guaranteed  to be representative .Stratified Sampling 
72 CDS 533Stratified  sampling  involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in 
important ways (e.g., gender identity, age range, income bracket, job role).  
•Rely on stratified sampling when a population’s characteristics are diverse and they 
want to ensure that every characteristic is properly represented in the sample. 
Stratified Sampling 
73 CDS 533
•To use  stratified  sampling,  you  need  to be able  to divide  your  population  into  mutually  exclusive  
and  exhaustive  subgroups . 
•Every  member  of the population  can  be ONLY  classified  into  one  subgroup .
•Best  choice  when  you  believe  that  subgroups  will have  different  mean  values  for the variable(s)  
you’re  studying . Stratified Sampling 
74 CDS 533It has  several  potential  advantages :
•Ensuring  the diversity  of your  sample
•Ensuring  similar  variance
•Lowering  the overall  variance  in the population
•Allowing  for a variety  of data  collection  methods
Cluster Sampling 
75 CDS 533Cluster  sampling   divides  a population  into  smaller  groups  known  as clusters  (each  cluster  
should  have  similar  characteristics  to the whole  sample) . They  then  randomly  select  among  
these  clusters  to form  a sample .
•It is often  used  to study  large  populations,  particularly  those  that  are widely  
geographically  dispersed . 
•Researchers  usually  use  pre-existing  units  such  as schools  or cities  as their  clusters .
Cluster Sampling 
76 CDS 533•This  method  is good  for dealing  with  large  and  dispersed  populations .
•There  is more  risk  of error  in the sample,  as there  could  be substantial  differences  between  
clusters . 
•It’s difficult  to guarantee  that  the sampled  clusters  are really  representative  of the whole  
population .
Multistage Sampling 
77 CDS 533Multistage  sampling , or multistage  cluster  sampling,  you  draw  a sample  from  a 
population  using  smaller  and  smaller  groups  (units)  at each  stage . It’s often  used  to collect  
data  from  a large,  geographically  spread  group  of people  in national  surveys . 
Multistage Sampling 
78 CDS 533
A combination  of different  sampling  methods .Multistage Sampling 
79 CDS 533
Advantage :
•No need tostart with asampling frame of target population .
•It’s relatively inexpensive and effective when have alarge orgeographically dispersed
population .
•It’sflexible— can vary sampling methods between stages based onwhat’sappropriate or
feasible .Sampling Techniques
80 CDS 533
Convenience Sampling 
81 CDS 533Convenience  sample  simply  includes  the individuals  who  happen  to be most  
accessible  to the researcher .
•Easier  and  cheaper  to access
•Ways  to collect : online,  social  media  post,  in-person,  crowdcourcing,  pre-existing  
groups,  ect..
•Higher  risk  of sampling  biasConvenience Sampling
